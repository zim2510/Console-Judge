# Console Judge


### System requirements:
1. Java 11+
2. Ubuntu 16.04 or better
3. Sublime Text 3

### How to use

cd into Console-Judge/out/production/Console-Judge/
Run "java Main.class" on your console for starting the program.

After the first run, the home directory will have a folder named "CJ" with two subfolders named "Problems" and "Users". Create a subfolder inside "Users" which should name exactly as "TestUser". You may add problems in the "Problems" folder. Each problem should have it's own subfolder in "Problems". Name of that subfolder will be used as the problem ID. So, I suggest to keep that name short. Each problem folder should have a few files named exactly as "Statement.pdf", "JUDGEIN" and "JUDGEOUT". Purpose of these files can be well understood simply by looking at their names.

### Hope you enjoy. :|
